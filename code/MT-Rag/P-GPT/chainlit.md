# Welcome to LangGraph Agent Demo! ðŸš€

This is a demo of a LangGraph-powered agent that can:
- Search the web using Tavily
- Query academic papers on ArXiv
- Maintain conversation state
- Check response helpfulness
- Loop until a satisfactory answer is found

## How to use
Simply type your question and the agent will:
1. Determine if it needs to use tools to answer
2. Search for information if needed
3. Provide a helpful response
4. Check if the response is satisfactory
5. Continue searching if needed

The agent will keep working until it finds a helpful answer or reaches the maximum number of iterations.
