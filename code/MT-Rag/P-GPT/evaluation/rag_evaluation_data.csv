What are the stages of labor and delivery?,"Labour and delivery are typically divided into four stages, each with its own unique characteristics and experiences. It's important to remember that every woman's labour is different, and the duration can vary from a few hours to a few days.

The first stage of labour is the longest and is divided into three phases: early, active, and transition. During the early phase, your cervix softens and opens to 3 to 4 cm, and your baby's head moves down into your pelvis. You may also experience diarrhea. As you move into the active phase, your cervix opens further to 8 to 9 cm, and contractions become stronger, occurring every 3 to 5 minutes and lasting 45 to 60 seconds. During this time, it's common to feel doubt about your ability to cope with the contractions. The transition phase is when your cervix opens fully to 10 cm, and you may feel a strong urge to push.

The second stage of labour begins when your cervix is fully dilated and ends with the birth of your baby. This stage can last from a few minutes to 2 or 3 hours. Your healthcare provider will monitor your baby's heartbeat every 5 minutes and may break your bag of waters if necessary.

The third stage of labour involves the delivery of the placenta, after which you can hold your baby skin-to-skin and may begin breastfeeding.

The fourth stage is the first few hours after birth, during which you can continue to hold your baby skin-to-skin until the end of your first feeding or for as long as you like.

Throughout labour, it's important to use relaxation techniques, focus on your breathing, and concentrate on one contraction at a time. Keep moving between contractions, sip fluids or suck on ice chips, and pee frequently. If you feel the urge to push, let someone know and use panting if you're not fully dilated yet.

Remember to call your healthcare provider or hospital if your contractions are regular and painful, your water breaks, you have vaginal bleeding or pinkish discharge, or if you're unsure and worried. In Canada, your healthcare provider will be there to support you throughout this process, and it's important to communicate with them about any concerns or questions you may have.

Remember, labour is a natural process, and while it can be challenging, it's also the path that leads to meeting your baby for the first time. It's normal to feel a range of emotions during this time, and it's okay to ask for help and support when you need it.

What are the recommended prenatal vitamins in Canada?,"In Canada, it's recommended that all women who could become pregnant, including those who are breastfeeding, take a daily multivitamin containing 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid [Maternity Guidelines Chapter 5 En]. This is particularly important during the early stages of pregnancy, as folic acid plays a crucial role in the development of your baby's neural tube.

In addition to folic acid, it's also important to ensure you're getting a balanced intake of other essential nutrients. These include thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, choline, vitamin A, vitamin D, selenium, and iodine. Deficiencies in these nutrients can affect the concentration in breastmilk and potentially impact your baby's health [Maternity Guidelines Chapter 5 En].

However, it's important to remember that everyone's nutritional needs are unique. Factors such as your overall health, lifestyle, and cultural background can all influence the type and amount of nutrients you need. Therefore, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare provider, such as a family physician, nurse practitioner, or obstetrician/gynaecologist, to determine the best prenatal vitamin regimen for you [Early Childhood Development In Canada En 20200106.Pdf 16 07 24 837].

If you're facing challenges in accessing nutritious food or knowledge about nutritious food, there are resources available to help. Nutritional counselling can provide you with information that's relevant to your specific needs and culture [Maternity Guidelines Chapter 5 En].

Remember, taking care of your nutritional needs is not just about ensuring your own health, but also about providing the best possible start for your baby. It's a crucial part of prenatal care, which has been shown to reduce the risk of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes [Early Childhood Development In Canada En 20200106.Pdf 16 07 24 837].

Pregnancy is a journey, and it's okay to have questions and concerns along the way. Don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider with any questions you may have. They are there to support you and ensure you and your baby are as healthy as possible.","Food Guide recommends regular intake of 
vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and protein foods. 
Deficiency of certain nutrients, including 
thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, 
choline, vitamin A, vitamin D, selenium, and 
iodine, can adversely affect the concentration in 
breastmilk.302 Health Canada recommends that all 
women who could become pregnant, including 
breastfeeding women, take a daily multivitamin 
containing 400 mcg (0.4 mg) of folic acid.302
Some women, for example those who live in low 
income, Indigenous women or women who are

social development and educational achievement. 
 
 
4.1 Prenatal Care 
Prenatal care is one of several health services in Canada that aims to improve maternal, fetal 
and infant health. Prenatal care has been shown to reduce the risk of maternal deaths and other 
adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, including miscarriage, premature births, low birth weight, 
and stillbirths, and is most effective if begun in the first trimester.171,172 Canada’s current standard 
of prenatal care ranks among the highest globally, with almost 95% of Canadian women starting 
their prenatal care in the first trimester of pregnancy.173 A similar proportion of all Canadian 
women give birth attended by a professionally educated health care provider (70% have an 
obstetrician/gynaecologist, 15% have a family physician, and about 4% have a midwife),174 and 
following the birth of their baby, the majority (93%) of women are contacted by a healthcare 
provider at home.175

supplements during the first three months of their pregnancy.116 The National Longitudinal Survey 
of Children and Youth reported that in 2008 only about 11% of women in Canada had consumed 
alcohol while pregnant117 and only about 12% had smoked while pregnant.118 However, there 
remains a small proportion of women whose circumstances may make it difficult for them to 
adhere to a healthy lifestyle while pregnant. Living in a low income household, young maternal age, 
being a single parent, and having poor access to or a distrustful relationship with healthcare 
providers are all barriers to maintaining good prenatal health.119,120  
Breastfeeding 
 Breastfeeding is important for the nutrition, immunologic protection, growth, and 
development of infants and toddlers,121 and is recommended by the World Health Organization122 
and by many Canadian organizations (e.g., Health Canada, PHAC, the Breastfeeding Committee for 
Canada, and the Canadian Paediatric Society) as the exclusive source of nutrition for the first six 
months, and for up to two years or longer with appropriate complementary feeding. Breastfeeding 
is not only associated with positive health outcomes for infants, but also decreases postpartum 
bleeding, protects the mother against certain cancers, and improves her bone health.121,123  
Breastfeeding is also important in strengthening the relationship between mothers and their 
babies.

What are the signs of preeclampsia?,"Preeclampsia is a condition that can occur during pregnancy and is characterized by high blood pressure and damage to other organs, often the liver and kidneys. It usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had been normal. It can lead to serious, even fatal, complications for both mother and baby if left untreated. 

The signs of preeclampsia can vary but often include:

- A headache that is persistent and severe
- Visual disturbances, such as blurred vision, light sensitivity, or temporary loss of vision
- Nausea and vomiting, particularly if these symptoms start or get worse suddenly after mid-pregnancy
- High blood pressure, which may be detected during your routine prenatal appointments
- Sudden weight gain and swelling, particularly in the face and hands

It's important to note that some women with preeclampsia may not experience any symptoms, or they may seem like normal pregnancy symptoms. Therefore, regular prenatal check-ups are crucial as they allow your healthcare provider to monitor your blood pressure and urine, which can help detect preeclampsia early.

If you experience any of these symptoms, it's important to contact your healthcare provider immediately. Preeclampsia can progress quickly, and early detection and treatment can help prevent severe complications.

In Canada, if you've had preeclampsia, your healthcare provider will likely recommend postpartum monitoring, as per the FAMILY-CENTRED MATERNITY AND NEWBORN CARE: NATIONAL GUIDELINES. This may include checking your blood pressure 3 to 6 days following birth, especially if your pregnancy was complicated by high blood pressure.

Remember, it's always best to discuss any concerns or symptoms with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with the most accurate information based on your personal health history and current situation. Pregnancy can be a time of joy but also anxiety, and it's important to know that support and help are available to you.","FAMILY-CENTRED MATERNITY AND NEWBORN CARE: NATIONAL GUIDELINES

During pregnancy, women may develop 
conditions such as preeclampsia and gestational 
diabetes mellitus (GDM) that put them at higher 
risk of heart disease and stroke. Pregnancy-related 
stroke can happen at any stage of pregnancy,  
but the greatest risk is during birth and the first 
few months postpartum. It is usually the result  
of a pre-existing blood vessel malformation or 
eclampsia. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM)  
is a rare—and often misdiagnosed—form of 
cardiomyopathy that occurs in the last month  
of pregnancy and up to 5 months postpartum.
There are a number of risk factors for peripartum 
cardiomyopathy: multiple pregnancies, twins, 
preeclampsia and eclampsia, a history of heart 
problems, excessive alcohol consumption, 
smoking, diabetes, obesity, unhealthy diet,  
and African heritage.176

incidence of postpartum hypertension. Women 
who have had chronic hypertension, gestational 
hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia  
may have preeclampsia postpartum—and  
may develop preeclampsia for the first time 
postpartum.174 As such, if a mother has 
hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HPD), 
postpartum monitoring is important.
Refer to the SOGC guideline Diagnosis, 
Evaluation, and Management of the Hypertensive 
Disorders of Pregnancy for information on care in 
the first 6 weeks postpartum and beyond. The 
Working Group recommends checking blood 
pressure 3 to 6 days following birth, especially

first- and second-degree lacerations. The more 
severe third- and fourth-degree lacerations  
that result in obstetrical anal sphincter injuries 
(OASIS) may occur in up to 11% of women  
who have vaginal births.177 OASIS may result in 
significant problems, including anal incontinence, 
rectovaginal fistula, and pain, along with increased 
risk of postpartum urinary retention.
Women who have lacerations during birth need to 
be made comfortable and helped to recover—and 
be supported in their confidence in caring for  
their baby. Provide information so that the woman 
understands what happened during the birth and","FAMILY-CENTRED MATERNITY AND NEWBORN CARE: NATIONAL GUIDELINES

4.4 CARDIOVASCULAR AND 
HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS  
OF PREGNANCY
Hypertension affects 6% to 10% of pregnant 
women, but few studies have reported the 
incidence of postpartum hypertension. Women 
who have had chronic hypertension, gestational 
hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia  
may have preeclampsia postpartum—and  
may develop preeclampsia for the first time 
postpartum.174 As such, if a mother has 
hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HPD), 
postpartum monitoring is important.
Refer to the SOGC guideline Diagnosis, 
Evaluation, and Management of the Hypertensive 
Disorders of Pregnancy for information on care in 
the first 6 weeks postpartum and beyond. The 
Working Group recommends checking blood 
pressure 3 to 6 days following birth, especially  
if the woman has had a pregnancy complicated 
by high blood pressure.175

preeclampsia and eclampsia, a history of heart

It is important to describe the signs and symptoms 
of heart disease and stroke to women and their 
families and explain when to talk to an HCP or

4.5 EXTENSIVE PERINEAL TEARS
Approximately 53% to 79% of women experience 
some form of laceration during vaginal birth—
most often in the perineal body and commonly 
first- and second-degree lacerations. The more 
severe third- and fourth-degree lacerations  
that result in obstetrical anal sphincter injuries 
(OASIS) may occur in up to 11% of women  
who have vaginal births.177 OASIS may result in 
significant problems, including anal incontinence, 
rectovaginal fistula, and pain, along with increased 
risk of postpartum urinary retention.
Women who have lacerations during birth need to 
be made comfortable and helped to recover—and 
be supported in their confidence in caring for  
their baby. Provide information so that the woman 
understands what happened during the birth and","Common signs of preeclampsia include:
1. High blood pressure (140/90 or higher)
2. Protein in urine
3. Severe headaches
4. Vision changes
5. Upper abdominal pain
6. Swelling in face and hands"
What are the recommended weight gain guidelines during pregnancy in Canada?,"In Canada, the recommended weight gain during pregnancy varies depending on your pre-pregnancy weight. It's important to remember that these are general guidelines and individual experiences can vary. 

If you were underweight before pregnancy, the recommended weight gain is between 28 to 40 lbs (12.5 to 18 kg). For those with a normal pre-pregnancy weight, the suggested weight gain is 25 to 35 lbs (11.5 to 16 kg). If you were overweight, the recommendation is 15 to 25 lbs (7 to 11.5 kg), and for those who were obese, the suggested weight gain is 11 to 20 lbs (5 to 9 kg) [Pregnancypassport].

In your first trimester, a small weight gain is best, around 1 to 4½ lbs (500 grams to 2 kg) in total. In your second and third trimesters, aim to gain at a steady rate of about ½ to 1 lb (200 to 500 grams) per week [Babys Best Chance.Pdf 16 07 24 778].

Remember, these are just guidelines and everyone's body responds differently to pregnancy. It's important to focus on healthy eating and maintaining an active lifestyle, rather than fixating on the numbers on the scale. If you have concerns about your weight gain, it's always best to consult with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances.

If you're expecting twins, your healthcare provider will be able to give you specific weight gain recommendations. 

It's also important to note that weight loss and dieting are not recommended during pregnancy. Your body needs extra nutrients to support your baby's growth and development. 

Remember, gaining too much weight during pregnancy can increase your risk for gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and can lead to a more difficult delivery. On the other hand, gaining too little weight can also pose risks, such as low birth weight for your baby. 

If you need more information or have specific dietary concerns, you can call HealthLink BC at 8-1-1 to speak with a registered dietitian.

Healthy Pregnancy Weight Gain
Gaining weight is a natural part of pregnancy. It helps your baby grow and develop,  
and prepares you for breast/chest feeding. Your healthy pregnancy weight depends  
on your weight before you got pregnant. 
The following guidelines may be useful for you, but keep in mind that weight gain  
will be different for everybody. Speak with your health-care provider if you are  
concerned that you are gaining too much or too little weight.
Evidence shows that women/individuals who gain the recommended amount of weight  
during pregnancy have fewer complications, such as Cesarean section, gestational hypertension, 
and low or high birth weight babies.

What are the safe exercises during pregnancy?,"It's wonderful that you're looking to stay active during your pregnancy! Regular exercise can help prepare your body for labour and delivery, maintain a healthy weight, improve your mood and energy level, reduce backache and constipation, lower your risk of gestational diabetes, and even help you sleep better. 

Safe exercises during pregnancy include swimming or aquafit, low-impact aerobics or prenatal fitness classes, prenatal yoga, canoeing, and fishing. Walking and riding a stationary bike are also great options. Remember, the goal is to aim for 2½ hours of moderate-intensity activity each week, spread out over at least 3 days or, even better, do something every day. 

It's also important to keep in mind some safety tips when exercising. Don't lie flat on your back if it makes you feel light-headed or nauseated. Don't hold your breath - breathe out on exertion and in when you relax. Use low weights and high repetitions (12 to 15) for strength training, and reduce the weights as your pregnancy progresses. Drink water before, during, and after activity, and make sure to stretch comfortably and do gentle warm-ups and cool-downs before and after exercise. 

Avoid activities involving bouncing or fast changes in direction, contact sports, activities that will overheat you, and scuba diving. If you experience extreme shortness of breath, chest pain, more than 6 to 8 painful contractions per hour, or bleeding or a gush of liquid from your vagina, stop exercising, sit down, drink water, and contact your healthcare provider or HealthLink BC at 8-1-1.

Remember, it's not just about going to the gym. You can keep your body moving with day-to-day activities like taking the stairs, raking leaves, or getting off the bus one stop away and walking the rest of the way to work. 

Lastly, as your pregnancy progresses, pay attention to your posture to avoid pain in your back, shoulders, and hips. Wear comfortable, supportive shoes and loose clothing, and sleep on your side with a pillow between your knees. 

Always consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new exercise regimen during pregnancy. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and current condition.
