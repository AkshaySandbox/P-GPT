## üîÑ Chunking Strategy

### Default Chunking Implementation
The project uses a specialized document splitting strategy implemented in `pregnancy_kb/document_processor.py`:

The system uses a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with the following configuration:

```
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=300,  # Characters per chunk
    chunk_overlap=CHUNK_OVERLAP,
    separators=["\n\n", "\n", ".", "!", "?", ",", " ", ""],
    length_function=tiktoken_len,
)
```

1. **Chunk Size**: 300
   - Documents are split into manageable chunks
   - Each chunk maintains context coherence
   - Chunks are processed in batches for efficient vector store insertion

2. **Chunking Rationale**:
   - **Context Preservation**: Ensures medical information isn't fragmented
   - **Semantic Coherence**: Maintains the integrity of related information
   - **Retrieval Optimization**: Balances chunk size for effective similarity search

3. **Processing Flow**:
   ```python
   documents = load_pdf_documents()
   splits = split_documents(documents)
   vector_store.add_documents(splits)
   ```

### Why This Chunking Decision?

#### **Chunk Size (300 characters):**:
   - Small enough to maintain context specificity
   - Large enough to capture meaningful information
   - Optimized for pregnancy-related medical content where precise information needs to be preserved

#### **Recursive Splitting**
- Uses a hierarchy of separators (`\n\n`, `\n`, `.`, etc.)
- Preserves natural text boundaries
- Prevents splitting in the middle of important medical terms or instructions

#### **Custom Length Function**
- Uses `tiktoken_len` for accurate token counting
- Ensures consistency with LLM token limits
- Better handles medical terminology and specialized vocabulary

#### **Metadata Preservation**
- Each chunk maintains original document metadata
- Adds section identification based on the first line
- Includes unique chunk IDs for traceability

#### **Category Classification** 
- Each chunk is categorized into specific pregnancy-related topics
- Categories include:
  - `prenatal`
  - `labor_delivery`
  - `postpartum`
  - `newborn_care`
  - `maternal_health`
  - `complications`
  - `nutrition`
  - `mental_health`
  - `canadian_benefits`
- Helps in targeted information retrieval and context maintenance



# Conclusions on Pipeline Performance and Effectiveness

## Strengths

### a) High Faithfulness (0.714)
- This is the strongest metric, indicating the system provides accurate and consistent information.
- Particularly important for medical/pregnancy advice where accuracy is crucial.
- Suggests the combination of custom embeddings and GPT-3.5 Turbo is effective for maintaining factual accuracy.

### b) Domain-Specific Optimization
- Custom-trained MPNet embeddings for pregnancy content.
- Well-structured categorization system (9 specific categories).
- Targeted web search restricted to official Canadian health websites.
- These optimizations help maintain domain relevance.

## Areas of Concern

### a) Context Precision (0.511)
- The lowest scoring metric.
- Suggests the retrieval system isn't always pulling the most relevant context.
- **Possible causes:**
  - Chunk size (300 characters) might be too small for some complex medical concepts.
  - Vector similarity might not always capture medical relevance effectively.

### b) Answer Relevancy (0.581)
- Moderate performance indicates responses sometimes drift from the question.
- Could be improved with better prompt engineering or context filtering.
- Might benefit from larger context windows.

### c) Context Recall (0.580)
- Moderate recall suggests some relevant information is being missed.
- **Possible causes:**
  - Conservative chunk overlap settings.
  - Limited context window size.
  - Potential gaps in the knowledge base.

## System Architecture Implications

### a) RAG Pipeline Effectiveness
- The system balances between knowledge base retrieval and web search.
- Hybrid approach helps compensate for gaps in either source.
- But metrics suggest room for optimization in retrieval strategy.

### b) Chunking Strategy Impact
- The 300-character chunk size might be contributing to the lower context precision.
- Small chunks maintain specificity but might fragment important medical concepts.
- Could benefit from dynamic chunk sizing based on content type.

## Recommendations for Improvement

### a) Short-term Optimizations:
- Increase chunk size for complex medical concepts.
- Implement better context filtering before LLM processing.
- Add medical-specific relevance scoring to retrieval.

### b) Structural Changes:
- Consider implementing a hierarchical retrieval system.
- Add medical concept linking across chunks.
- Implement fact-checking against medical databases.

### c) Evaluation Framework:
- Add medical accuracy as a specific metric.
- Implement user feedback loops.
- Track performance by category.

## Risk Assessment

### a) Medical Information Reliability
- High faithfulness (0.714) is good but not perfect for medical advice.
- System appropriately includes disclaimers.
- Conservative approach with official source citations.

### b) Information Coverage
- Moderate recall (0.580) suggests potential information gaps.
- **Mitigated by:**
  - Multiple information sources.
  - Clear source attribution.
  - Fallback to official resources.
